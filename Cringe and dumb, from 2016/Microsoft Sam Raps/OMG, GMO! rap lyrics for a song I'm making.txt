Sam:

Your plate might've had those GMO's that will make you go "OMG". Loaded with pesticides, herbicides, add that with the insecticides. High fructose corn syrup, your stomach wasn't born for this stir-up. Food colouring, your life's colours will fade away from its effects. Aspartame, I'm getting sick of their trash part. GMO's are too low to go! Monsanto, Syngenta, Bayer, Dow, BASF, your pesticides being sprayed in the air are too toxic to bear, and everyone's too scared to go there. What are you goin' down to? Now all of your profits are running low because people are waking up to the world around them, rejecting those pesticide-laden produce and antibiotic-ridden meats made using your technology. The USDA, the FDA, the EPA, and many more, are deciding on bans to those products that bring money to your hands. Now all your profits are going in the trash from you wasting them on attempts against GMO bans on this land. What are you going to do now?

Ace:

Nothing is more important than driving a corporate empire out of the market, mark my words! Because stores and restaurants everywhere are hearing more from the crowd, screaming to demand a ban to your line of grime. Yeah, nobody wants to feed their families with glyphosate in their meals! They're waking up, taking down, breaking down, making up, this town ain't used to your RoundUp and neonics anymore! We're moving on to a cleaner environment, helping those endangered bees and other insects from your tease. There will be no more companies endorsing your technology, as all of that haste is going to waste. That's right, GMO's have got to go! Your paradise of money and attention is coming to a close...


(chorus)

Ace: What digests so slow?

Sam/Mike/Mary: GMO's!

Ace: What does our food system place so low?

Sam/Mike/Mary: GMO's!

Ace: What do those companies not want us to know?

Sam/Mike/Mary: OMG, GMO's!

Ace: What digests so slow?

Sam/Mike/Mary: GMO's!

Ace: What does our food system place so low?

Sam/Mike/Mary: GMO's!

Ace: What do those companies not want us to know?

Sam/Mike/Mary: OMG, GMO's!

Sam: There's no way you can put those in your body without your immune system being snotty, oh how much we hate the idea of GMO foods into first place, since 1994 when they were put into the marketing fray.

Ace: 

Dozens of countries have already turned away from your technology because of its criminal bottom-line that is filled with nothing but lies. Your groups need to have their products removed from the shelves, and your reputation has to be disposed from yourselves!



(interviewing of characters)

Microsoft Zira:

I've seen one of the scariest things happening to today's generation, and this proves we need to start protecting the people, and not corporate profits.


Microsoft David:

Monsanto, the company that created the idea of genetically-modified organisms, has been responsible for the brainwashing of companies, federal agencies, and the US Government; the endangering of bees, monarch butterflies, and other important insects; and even petitioning to keep themselves from getting into major legal trouble. All Monsanto cares about is money, and protection of their profits. If you're looking to buy foods, always look for the Non-GMO Project Verified stamp on the package, or the USDA Organic stamp.

(back to rapping)

Sam: You may think the GMO's are good for world hunger and dealing with droughts, but in reality they don't seem to cut it. Instead, they've only failed to boost sales, stir up lawsuits, and you destroying small farms and independent food groups for the LOLz and cash, and now with you being put on trial recently your reputation's going in the trash.

Ace:

Not only do modern food systems not work, but factory farms that cram animals like jerks, treating them with antibiotics and your GMO feed in an environment that's never been clean, meaning that factory-farmed meats are more prone to disease and lack the nutrition that they have in places where traditional farms cash out. You know what I'm talking about, you have been dumped by the eastern countries that don't want their traditions to slump.

Sam/Mike/Mary: OMG, GMO's!


Ace:

*a few seconds later*
Yeah... You'd better run for the hills... Because your technology kills... And your biotech empire gives us the chills...


Sam:

Monsanto is the monster of all, Syngenta makes the injections to our fruits and vegetables, Bayer adds a much dirtier layer, BASF stands for "Breaking A System of our Future", and Dow has made us all go down to the emergency room...

Ace:

People, do as I say and avoid all GMO's and factory-farmed oh's of meat raised with antibiotics and carcinogens, and have a nice day...
