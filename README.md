## Unpublished tracks, but still probably finished
- brunachechampion: Pokemon fangame battle theme made for me back in late 2018 by Adonai Tauras/Brunache before he was outed, and then covered as a MIDI version by me because it could easily sound fitting that way.
- "red" or "projectventurachampionmidi": Same as brunachechampion, but for battling Red like in Gold/Silver/Crystal.
- Anything to do with being from a dream: Exactly what the name implies, music that I heard in dreams and covered by memory.
- galaxian, warpwarp: Remake of a few short game soundtracks.
- GoAnimate Dance remix: Dank meme remix of "DANCE.MID" from partnersinrhyme, mostly known as "Dance" on GoAnimate.
- jubr jackpot: Unreleased Sega Genesis cover of the jackpot theme from Joe's Ultimate Bus Ride.
- MSGS (MIDI) version of SammieVL_Gametheme made back in 2018 before her transition if I remember right.
